{"pull_number":"17628","title":"Kitest-based Test Harness","body":"<!--\r\nThank you for improving Nushell!\r\nPlease, read our contributing guide: https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds the new test harness based on [kitest](https://crates.io/crates/kitest) in `nu-test-support`. It allows us to put tests into groups with shared setup and teardown which will allow us in the future to move integration tests in-process instead of shelling out. It runs without issues with `cargo-nextest` and does not impose changes to existing tests or the way tests have to be written.\r\n\r\nBut it allows tests to have additional attributes that modify its execution context:\r\n- `#[env(KEY = \"value\")]` allows setting environment variables for a test\r\n- `#[exp(nu_experimental::EXAMPLE = true)]` allows setting experimental options for a test\r\n- `#[serial]` allows running tests serially instead of multithreaded if they need that\r\n\r\nThis PR does not introduce changes in the tests themselves (besides some applied test attributes).\r\n\r\n## Release notes summary - What our users need to know\r\n<!--\r\nThis section will be included as part of our release notes.
